        <p>
            CoderPahadi is a coding blog where I post blogs related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and nodeJs projects. Here I also provide the source codes of my YouTube videos for free of cost and you can use them without any restrictions or limitations. I believe my videos or codes help to inspire web designers & developers to improve their skills. <br><br>

Iâ€™m Brijesh and I am a self-taught front-end developer from Delhi. Internet and web development is my passion and I believe in helping people with my abilities and knowledge. I am learning these things for the last 2 years and now it feels like learning is a part of my life.<br><br>

I have a YouTube channel also where I upload videos on different coding projects which makes this experience even more interesting.<br><br>

I hope my contents are helpful for you and you will learn something new from them. Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br><br>

If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to tell me through the <a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a> page.
